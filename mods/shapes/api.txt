Shapes API Reference
====================

Basic Registration
==================
shapes:register_shapes("<modname>:<nodename>")

-- Register all shapes based on the definition from <nodename>
-- adds "not_in_creative_inventory" to groups
-- sunlight_propagates depends on the shapes' defintion by default.

Optional Customization
======================
If any of these values are not provided, the api will attempt to retrieve data based from either the node definition or shape definition

shapes:register_shapes("<modname>:<nodename>", {
	disabled = "<shape1>, <shape2>, <shape3>"		-- Makes certain shape not generate
	<shape>_description = "Description",
	<shape>_tiles = {"texture1", "texture2"..},		-- Priority over global_tiles
	global_tiles = {"texture1", "texture2"..},		-- Not applicable for pane/fence/wall
	texture = "texture1",							-- global texture for only pane/fence/wall
	<shape>_sunlight_propagates = <boolean>,
	groups = {groups}								-- not_in_creative_inventory in applied by default
	<shape>_drop = <dropname>,						-- Priority over drop
	drop = <dropname>,
	<shape>_light_source = <integer>,				-- Priority over light_source
	light_source = <integer>,
	<shape>_backface_culling = <boolean>,			-- Priority over backface_culling (Not applicable for meshnodes/pane/fence/wall)
	backface_culling = <boolean>,					-- Not applicable for meshnodes/pane/fence/wall
	<shape>_align_style = "style",					-- Priority over align_style (Not applicable for meshnodes/pane/fence/wall)
	backface_culling = "style",						-- Not applicable for meshnodes/pane/fence/wall
})
