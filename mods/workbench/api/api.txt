Workbench Crafting API Reference
================================

workbench:register_craft
------------------------
* type (optional)
	* Custom crafting type -- register a new type with `workbench:register_crafttype`
	* Support builtin types (normal, cooking)
	* Defaults to "normal" if no value supplied
* category (optional)
	* Custom crafting category
* time (optional)
	* Custom crafting time
	* Not applied, to be interpreted by user
* mod (optional)
	* Modifications
	* Supports: shapeless
* input
	* Recipe input
	* Nested table format only
	* All rows must have equal width
	* Supports unlimited width and height
	* Supports count / amount
	* Supports group(s), use "group" prefix and comma with no spacing for multiple
	* ^ e.g. group:dye,color_red (both dye AND color_red groups)
* output
	* Recipe output
	* Nested table format only
	* All rows must have equal width
	* Supports unlimited width and height
	* Supports count / amount
* residue (optional)
	* Secondary output
	* For custom output(s), no format limitation
* extra (optional)
	* Tertiary output 
	* For custom output(s), no format limitation
* replacements (optional)
	* Replace items from input to input
	* Identical to minetest.register_craft replacements
	* Items registered in pairs
* transfer_meta (optional)
	* Transfer metadata from input to output
	* Items registered in pairs similar to replacements
	* count is ignored, the main criteria is name matches
* multi_id
	* Used for multiple-output
	* Provided string can be same across craft types, but must be different across craft categories
	* Multiple-output allows recipes with the same input to have a table of output rather than confined to output/residue/extra
	
### Behaviour
* Ported toolrepair
	* Should function similar to builtin toolrepair
	* Necessary to add toolrepair support to workbench:register_craft because its not possible to extract it
* Backward compatible
	* workbench:register_craft will recognize most old crafts registered by minetest.register_craft
	* Exception is fuel & toolrepair, the latter is ported
	* Do note that functions that interact with the old minetest.register_craft like minetest.register_on_craft, minetest.register_craft_predict are not compatible, but workbench exposures the crafting process completely such that you can craft your own methods easily with greater flexibility
* Not forward compatible
	* minetest.register_craft does not interact with workbench:register_craft and does not recognize its crafts

workbench:register_crafttype(name)
----------------------------------
Adds a new custom crafting type called <name>
Required before registrating new crafts in that type - for error logging and identification

Additional (optional) fields:
* description
	* craft type description (used for crafting guide when identifying type)
* icon
	* craft type icon (used for crafting guide when identifying type)

Example
-------
workbench:register_craft({
	type = "crafting_type",
	cat = "crafting_category",
	time = 10,
	mod = "modification",
	input = {
		{"item1", "item2 4", "item3"}, -- "item2 4"; need x4 of item2 for a single working craft
		{"item4", "item5", "item6"},
	},
	output = {
		{"item1", "item2", "item3"},
		{"item4 9", "item5", "item6"}, -- "item4 9"; outputs x9 of item 4 for a single craft
	},
	residue = {},
	extra = {},
	replacements = {
		{"replacED_item1", "replacING_item1 6"}, -- "replacING_item1 6"; x1 replacED_item1 will be replaced by x6 replacING_item1
		{"replacED_item2", "replacING_item2"},
	}
	transfer_meta = {
		{"from_item1", "to_item1"},
		{"from_item2", "to_item2"},
	}
})

workbench:register_crafttype("crafting_type") -- Adds a new custom crafting type called <crafting_type>

Functions
---------
### workbench.to_invlist(list)

Returns a inventory list from a supplied table/list
E.g. {"item1", "item2"} > {ItemStack1, ItemStack2}

### workbench.craft_output(input_list, crafting_type, crafting_category, input_list_width)

Returns output and various variables from an input list
See below for further details
"Input Variables" - data to input
"Output Variables" - output data if there's a successful output found, else returns nil

Input Variables (workbench.craft_output)
---------------
* input_list
	* Inventory list
	* Said list should function as a crafting grid
* crafting_type
	* Limits search to a specified crafting_type
* crafting_category
	* Limits search to a specified crafting_category
* input_list_width
	* Width of input_list
* multiplier (integer)
	* How many times to multiply a craft
	* Allows for output in stacks rather than singular recipe
	* Subjected to item's max_stack, will return largest possible before reaching that value
* listall (multiple output / bool)
	* To be used in conjunction with multi_id
	* When set to true, it returns a table of possible outputs rather than a singular one

Output Variables (workbench.craft_output)
----------------
Returns in a table with these variables:
* item
	* Recipe output
	* nil if no recipe detected
	* Inventory list format
	* transfer_meta variables are applied automatically
* max (max craftable)
	* Maximum amount of times the crafting can be applied based on given ingredients from input_list
	* Number is a multiplier not a direct amount; for example:
		* Recipe is 3 cobblestone gives 5 stone
		* input_list has 14 cobblestone
		* max_craftable will return 4
		* this means you can craft a maximum of 4 x 3 cobblestone, the remaining 2 cobblestone cannot be crafted into stone
* dinput (decremented_input)
	* Similar to decremented input from minetest.get_craft_result
	* After crafting once, how many ingredients are left over
	* replacements are applied automatically if there's space
	* Inventory list format
* time
	* Crafting time if provided
	* Returns 0 if not provided
* recipe
	* Returns original recipe that was detected
	* Directly extracted from workbench:register_craft input, format as per (nested table)
	* Does not support minetest.register_craft crafts, it will return a nil instead
		* Reason: there's no reliable way to determine said recipe
* replacements
	* Returns replacements or if empty, empty table
	* Directly extracted from workbench:register_craft replacements, format as per (Nested table)
	* Should be redundant, this is applied automatically in decremented_input, but should the user have a need for it
* residue
	* Returns residue or if empty, empty table
	* Directly extracted from workbench:register_craft residue, format as per (table)
	* Intention is for user to use it as a secondary output list, but to be interpreted by user 
* extra
	* Returns extra or if empty, empty table
	* Directly extracted from workbench:register_craft extra, format as per (table)
	* Intention is for user to use it as a tertiary output list, but to be interpreted by user
* multiply
	* How many times a craft is multiplied
	* To be used in conjunction with multiplier, otherwise default value is 1
	
Workbench Fuel API Reference
============================

workbench:register_fuel
-----------------------

	* Support builtin types (normal)
	* Defaults to "normal" if no value supplied
* cat (optional)
	* Custom crafting category
* time
	* Custom fuel time
	* To be interpreted by user, but intention is burntime
* fuel
	* Fuel item - item used for fuel
	* Single item only (string)
	* Supports count / amount

workbench:register_fueltype(name)
---------------------------------
Adds a new custom fuel type called <name>

	cat = "fuel_category",
	time = 1300,
	fuel = "fuelitem 4",
})

workbench:register_fueltype("fuel_type") -- Adds a new custom fuel type called <fuel_type>

Functions
---------
### workbench:get_fuel(input_list, fuel_type, fuel_category)

Returns output and various variables from an input list
See below for further details
"Input Variables" - data to input
"Output Variables" - output data if there's a successful output found, else returns nil

Input Variables (workbench:get_fuel)
---------------
* input_list
	* Inventory list
	* Said list should function as a fuel input
	* Currently only support lists with a single slot ***
* fuel_type
	* Limits search to a specified fuel_type
* fuel_category
	* Limits search to a specified fuel_category

Output Variables (workbench:get_fuel)
----------------
Returns in specified order:
1. fuel_time
	* == burntime for the old system
2. decremented_input
	* Similar to decremented input from minetest.get_craft_result
	* After crafting once, how many ingredients are left over
	* replacements are applied automatically if there's space
	* Inventory list format
